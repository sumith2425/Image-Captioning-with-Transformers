## Project Overview

This project focuses on image captioning and model identification, divided into three parts:

*   **Part A:** Implements and benchmarks a custom Vision Transformer (ViT) + GPT-2 based image captioning model against a zero-shot SmolVLM baseline. Performance is measured using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR scores.
*   **Part B:** Studies the robustness of both SmolVLM and the custom model under varying levels of image occlusion (10%, 50%, 80% patch masking). Performance degradation is measured and recorded.
*   **Part C:** Builds and trains a BERT-based text classifier to distinguish whether a given caption (along with the original caption and perturbation level) was generated by SmolVLM (Model A) or the custom model (Model B), using the data generated in Part B.

## Files

*   `dl-assign-2-parta_b.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for Part A and Part B.
*   `DL_Assign2_PART_C.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for Part C.
*   `DL_Assign2_Report.pdf` (or `.docx`): The final project report containing Methodology, Results, and Analysis for all parts. (Note: You will combine the Part A/B structure provided earlier with your Part C report).
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x (Tested with Python 3.10)
*   PyTorch (`torch`)
*   Hugging Face Libraries:
    *   `transformers`
    *   `datasets`
    *   `accelerate` (for efficient training)
*   Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)
*   Pandas (`pandas`)
*   NLTK (`nltk`) (Often required for metric calculation like BLEU)
*   Rouge Score (`rouge_score`)
*   BERT Score (`bert_score`) or other METEOR implementations if needed.
*   A suitable environment like Google Colab (recommended) or a local machine with a GPU (approx. 15GB VRAM recommended, e.g., NVIDIA T4, V100).
